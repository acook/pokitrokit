===========

So, I'm playing around with sockets and TCP servers.

I was just going to call it "socket" but that was clearly going to cause issues. Then I was just going to go with "sock" but thats no good either, then I realized "pocket" was kinda like a sock and it also rhymed with socket, and it was all downhill from there.
